            <h3 style="text-align: center;"> Home vs Away In Club Cricket</h3>
            <p> 1. KKR won the tournamnet with better Away record in 2014. <br> 
            2. MI had better Home record in 2010 compared to 2015 and 2017 when they <br>
            won the titles.<br>
            3. RR won 100% of their Home games in 2013 but did not win the title. <br> 
            4. SRH performed their best at both Home and Away games in 2013 but did not <br>
            qualify for the elminiators. </p>
            <h4> Therefore, on the basis of factual evidence it is
            difficult to conclude that home game advantage exists in
            like it does in Football.</h4>

            <h3 style="text-align: center;"> Influence on Test Cricket </h3>
            <p> 1. Average number of test matches per year since the year 2000
                have been around 40-45 tests per year with only a few minor exceptions. Therefore, <br>
                therefore there has been no serious decline in the number of test matches held.<br>
                every year. <br>
                2. Only in the years when a major ICC tournament like World Cup or Champions/<br>
                Knockout Trophy were organised there was an obvious dip in the number of test <br>
                matches.<br> 
                3. Historically some nations have played more test matches than others dur to their <br>
                early participation. </p>
                <h4> Evidently evolution of T20 or club cricket has not
                negatively influenced test cricket. On the contrary, more
                more test matches observe a result rather than draw now. <br></h4>
        </div>
        <div class="column-conclusion" style="background-color: floralwhite;color: dimgrey;">
            <h3 style="text-align: center;"> Efficiency of DRS </h3>
            <p> 1. Bowlers tend to take more DRS calls than Batsmen but bowlers had
                the last laugh as 74% of their reviews were upheld. Which means umpires had to 
                overturn their decision.<br>
                2. It is a popular pratice amongst batters to go for a review even if odds
                of umpire's decision to be overturned are slim. This is reflective in their
                upheld percentage. <br> 
                3. Some umpires in general are challenged more than others meanwhile best umpire <br>
                showcase high review struck down and umpire's call rate. </p>
                <h4> Opting for a review depends on a number of factors such <br>
                as team position (bowling/ batting), ground, umpire and furthermore, 
                is also an individualistic choice of batsman in strike. Therefore, <br>
                main idea is to assist correct decision making up to the satisfaction 
                of both teams which is not exactly reflected in percentages.</h4>
